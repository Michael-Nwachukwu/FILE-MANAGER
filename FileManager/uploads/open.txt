My dearest darling peaches. I rose this morning feeling rather elated. Albeit not quite remembering my dreams, I’m quite positive they must be of you. As a result I am certain that today will have to be a good one no doubt. My home has since been invaded by, and I choose my words carefully such unchivalrous spirit that is my Eldest brother. It is now a while he returned and I must confess, my patience and tolerance is running thin…..alarmingly. It is of course no news that this is the first time I’m spending such considerable amount of time with him since my youth was passed. I however have noticed quite to my disgust such ill manners and crippling laxity recorded in him, alas the elders do not know any better. I hope my heart stays fast in containing this torrent wrath brewing inside of me. 
My darling one. I hope you make the best of today and enjoy the travails that comes with the day, and the pleasures even more as I count the minutes till you’re in my arms again. 
Yours in Love,  
                                                                                                                                                                                
Baby.
